Simple-RPG
==========

Creating a simple Role Playing Game designed to explore Python's class function as well as importing files.
==========

Using Python, the general idea of the project is to create an indepth turn based battle system which can generate content and adapt to any number of Player Characters (PC) or Non Player Characters (NPC). This will include both friendly and hostile NPC. Once the battle system is established, I intend to add Role Playing Game (RPG) elements such as stats that affect combat and equipable items that might require certain stats to use. 

My main objective here is to practice writing code and build up the tools I'll need in the future to work on other projects. The game itself will probably always be a work in progress as I improve my skills and move onto other things.

And then there was light.
